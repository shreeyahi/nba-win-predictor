# NBA Win Predictor (Machine Learning)

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict which NBA team is more likely to win based on offensive and defensive efficiency averages (Points Per Game scored and allowed).

The model is trained on a set of toy NBA-style statistics and allows the user to input season averages for both teams. It then returns:
- predicted winner (home or away)
- and estimated win probability

## 🏀 Why this project?
I am a big basketball fan, especially the Golden State Warriors, and I wanted to start building AI applications that combine my personal interests with data science & machine learning.

This will eventually evolve into a larger portfolio of sports analytics and AI projects connected to the NBA.
